# Networks Playground

This repository is a small experimental playground for understanding application-layer networking concepts using Python sockets.

# Current State

- Client ↔ Server communication over TCP

- Application-layer message framing using delimiter-based parsing

- Correct handling of TCP byte-stream fragmentation and partial reads

- Multiple client-to-server connections via threading
